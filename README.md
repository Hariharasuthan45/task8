ðŸ“˜ K-Means Clustering (Without Dataset)


ðŸ”§ Project Name:

K-Means Clustering with Synthetic Data (No CSV)


ðŸ“Œ Objective:

Perform unsupervised learning using K-Means Clustering without using any external dataset. Data is generated within the code using random values.


ðŸ›  Tools Used:

Python 3.x (tested on 3.11+)

Libraries:

matplotlib for plotting

sklearn for clustering and evaluation

random for generating data




---

ðŸš€ How to Run:

1. Open IDLE or any Python editor.


2. Copy and paste the full code provided.


3. Run the script.


4. Youâ€™ll see:

Elbow Method plot

Cluster plot

Silhouette Score in terminal





---

ðŸ“ˆ What the Code Does:

Generates 20 random data points (income and score).

Uses Elbow Method to find the best number of clusters.

Applies K-Means with K=3.

Plots the clusters with colors.

ðŸ“¦ Dependencies:

If you're using a clean Python install, make sure these libraries are available:

pip install matplotlib scikit-learn

Usually, IDLE with Python 3.11 already includes them.

ðŸ“„ Sample Output:

Silhouette Score: 0.65
(2 plots will appear: Elbow method and clusters)
